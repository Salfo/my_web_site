# About

I am a joint Ph.D. Candidate in Economics and Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research interests are in the application and development of text analytics methods to study political leaders' role for economic development. More specifically, as part of my dissertation work, I apply topic modeling algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), in combination with multivariate methods, to show that political leaders' professed priorities can be measured through their public statements. Being able to measure leaders’ priorities allows the study of leaders’ commitments to their economic agendas and economic development. Indeed, the literature in political science supports that “goal driven” leaders are persistent and consistent in their public discourses; whereas “opportunistic leaders” shape their public statements in response to the news, and find it difficult to have a consistent message over time. My research agenda consists of using text analytics to measure political leaders’ consistency over their professed agendas and further study the association between consistency and policy outcomes.  
Currently, I work in developing a text analytics algorithm that jointly estimates the relationship between political leaders' public statements and some economic outcome variables, using variational expectation methods.
