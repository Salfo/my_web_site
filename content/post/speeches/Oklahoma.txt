                                                                         1                Governor Mary Fallin State of the State                             February 5, 2018Lieutenant Governor Lamb, statewide elected officials, Speaker McCall,President Pro Tem Schulz, members of the court, honorable senators andrepresentatives, Cabinet members, tribal leaders, distinguished guests,and citizens of Oklahoma –It is my honor to present to the second regular session of the 56thLegislature my State of the State address and the final one of myadministration.I would like to take a brief moment to thank my fellow Oklahomans forthe honor and the opportunity of a lifetime to serve as governor of thisgreat state. My family and I have really loved meeting so manyoutstanding Oklahomans from all across the state.Words cannot express how much I appreciate the sacrifices of my entirefamily, their love and support over the many years I have served thestate – my loving husband, Wade, and our combined family of sixchildren. Two of our children are here – Christina was just three yearsold when I sat at the back of this chamber over 27 years ago as afreshman legislator and my son, Price, was four months old. He’s out ofstate on a business trip. My stepson, Adam, and his wife, ElizabethChristensen, are here with us today.                                                                            2I also want to express my deep gratitude to my ‘extended family.’ Thatextended family includes three groups:    <U+F0B7> My faithful prayer warriors;    <U+F0B7> My Cabinet members and staff, past and present, and;    <U+F0B7> My informal advisory board composed of dozens – maybe       hundreds by now – of Oklahomans who intercept me when I’m       getting a Diet Coke at the On Cue on Northwest 23rd Street. They       make sure I slow down to listen to their wisdom, their concerns       and their common sense.I’d also like to thank all the legislators and elected officials for all ofyour work. We’ve set many goals since 2011, accomplishing much, andstill have more opportunities ahead of us. Legislators, it’s great to seeyou again. What has it been – a little more than a month since you’vemet here?Seriously, I appreciate all of your time and efforts during the past year,and agreeing to come to my calls for two special sessions. I feel we aremaking progress. I understand how difficult and challenging this pastyear has been for you.Tradition tempts me to take this opportunity to reflect on the past sevenyears on what has been my blessing to serve as governor of the state weall love. But today is not for yielding to tradition. Today is not to lookover our shoulder, but to press on ahead for a better future.And that, my friends, is the last you will hear from me today about theprevious seven years. Let’s focus on the future and make sure werecognize and embrace the opportunity we have in front of us.                                                                           3The constitution of the great state of Oklahoma makes it my duty todayto provide a budget and to report on the health of the state. Neither duty,however, will be fulfilled by what I say here. The budget and the healthof our state are not mine to determine. Instead, both will be decided bywhat this Legislature does in the next couple of weeks.Let us make no mistake about it: This is an historic, defining momentbefore us. What we do as a unified group of people elected by thecitizens of our state could be considered the moment in time thatchanged Oklahoma.We are in a unique period as this legislative session begins with aconcurrent special session. We also are at a special point in Oklahoma’sjourney because the prospect of a brighter path forward is so very near.Only in Oklahoma, would a group of private business and communityleaders care enough to work so tirelessly in a bipartisan manner to sculpta series of budget and reform compromises that can bring new life intoan entire state and put us on a better course.Only in Oklahoma, can we gather in this House of the People todemonstrate yet again what we know is at the heart of Oklahoma. Thebasic truth is this: When the hardest challenges come, when a crisisthreatens, that’s when Oklahomans rise as one to show our state, ournation and the world the Oklahoma Standard.Now, it is our solemn duty to raise the torch and show again that theOklahoma Standard lives. And when the people say we can’t do it, andwe can’t solve our budget crisis and give our teachers pay raise or wecan’t bring better accountability – let’s show them we can!                                                                          4Tradition also again tempts me now to talk you through the elements ofthe budget package you will be considering. Instead, the proposedbudget is detailed in the materials provided to you. By now we are allfamiliar with the choice before us with the Step Up Oklahoma plan.Yet, for all of us, there are parts of what is proposed that we may want toembrace, and there are parts that we may want to reject. Our goal thissession should be to fix our chronic budget crisis and address importantpolicy goals.We know there are no perfect solutions or plans. We know there is noperfect legislation. But, we also know that compromise is at the verycore of the budget on which you will vote. Just as compromise formedthe foundation of America, I believe compromise can fortify thefoundation of Oklahoma.As we consider recurring revenue, let’s be clear – it is not revenue alonethat gets us to a place of budget stabilization.We have to include reforms as well. My budget includes money foragency performance and accountability efforts, which will ensure publicresources are being spent appropriately and help address publicconfidence in state governance.Our state is at a crossroads. The actions we take will be a game-changer.It is time to decide which future we want our families and children tohave.One path would be to continue year after year with an air of uncertaintythat consumes our thoughts, drains our hopes – like the old saying ofrobbing Peter to pay Paul – then Paul runs out of cash. If we are to effectchange, we can’t keep doing the same old thing and expect a differentresult.                                                                         5That path will lead to more chaos at the Capitol. We have to askourselves – What kind of future do we want to have? Do we find itacceptable to have four-day school weeks? Is it acceptable for Texas tosteal our teachers and leave our classrooms short of teachers? We allknow Oklahomans expect us to beat Texas – on and off the footballfield!Do we just accept that without a budget fix, we will just cut providerrates and other essential health and human services for our most needyand vulnerable citizens? Do we believe the only solution to helping ourmothers and fathers and sons and daughters and friends who are notviolent, but need substance abuse treatment, is to warehouse them inprisons? Or will our state be more successful if we help them put theirfamilies back together, get jobs, and become taxpayers?Do we think this is just how it is and it’s the best Oklahoma can do? No.Absolutely not. We can and we must do better.We need to dig down deep in our souls and recall the OklahomaStandard of neighbor helping neighbor, as we did during the Murrahfederal building tragedy. We need to restore the attitude that we areOklahoma Strong. We can fix it – like we felt after the Moore tornadoesstruck. In the face of crisis, Oklahomans come together and solve theproblem.The people of Oklahoma expect excellence and demand we solve ourstate’s problems. That is why we were elected – to lead, roll up oursleeves, get to work, solve problems, and find solutions.This is a defining moment for our state. We have two clear choices – Wecan continue down a path of sliding backwards, or the second path is tosay “Enough is enough! We can do better! We deserve better! Ourchildren deserve better!”                                                                             6This is a great opportunity to address ongoing challenges, to strengthenour state’s image and brand.As we know, close to 100 Oklahomans from across the state havedeveloped a plan called Step Up Oklahoma to put our state on a fiscallystable path, bring about much-needed reform, give our teachers a $5,000pay raise, and break the gridlock. We don’t want to be like Washington,D.C.Because of the urgency of the situation, this outside group, in a veryshort time, has endorsed both reforms and revenue. They support ideasthat are against their own financial interests in order to further our state’sinterest. They have come together to help this legislative body unitebehind a plan to move Oklahoma forward.They did it because they love Oklahoma. We love Oklahoma. Now it istime for us to step up, be courageous, do our jobs, and pass this plan!Without passage of this plan, there are important policy initiatives thatcan’t be advanced. Initiatives that each of you are passionate about,whether it’s education, criminal justice reform, health and humanservices, transportation, or restructuring inefficient government entities.All five former Oklahoma governors, who are still with us – Republicanand Democrat - have endorsed this plan. They have shown us what it’slike to put aside partisan differences and join together for the good ofour state.The time to act is now.No more delaying. No more putting things off. No more kicking the candown the road. No more addressing long-term budget problems withshort-term solutions.We can do this, and we must do this now!                                                                             7Governor George Nigh said the Step Up Oklahoma plan would “help ourstate break free from the boom and bust cycle that harms allOklahomans.”He said the very nature of compromise means that Oklahomans on bothsides of the aisle may not like everything in this plan, but we must cometogether as Oklahomans and move past partisan politics that stand in theway of progress.Governor Frank Keating said: ‘Paralysis and dysfunction are notcredible public policies. Revenue failures damage the credibility of thestate. The civic and business leaders have thrown us a lifeline.”I’ll conclude with some final thoughts because this is a time for action.We’ve talked too long with no permanent solution. In fact, whenmembers of this Legislature cast votes on the budget in the days ahead,my prayer is you will remember your fellow Oklahomans’ dreams andhopes of a prosperous state.Before you cast your vote, focus on the teacher who will see a $5,000salary increase not just as a way to pay bills, but as a validation of theirvital vocation, and a business community that sees how committed weare to a strong, educated workforce.Or perhaps, as you reach for the vote button, you may want to picture inyour mind a caregiver who seeks the state’s help so an elderly mother orfather can live out their final years with security and dignityOr maybe – before your vote – think about the young college students inthis chamber. Much of their future and that of an entire generation ofOklahomans rests with the decision you make when we appropriatelyfund education.                                                                         8Remember the important policy initiatives we have implemented to be“smart on crime” with treatment for those with substance or mentalhealth issues and how it affects our state’s success.Too few Oklahomans are getting the treatment they need for substanceabuse and mental health issues, and are instead winding up in ourcriminal justice system.We need to stop warehousing moms and dads, sons and daughters inprison when many just need substance abuse treatment.We need to continue our focus, and can do so without jeopardizingpublic safety. There are bills proposed by the Oklahoma Justice ReformTask Force that are smart, data-driven solutions to safely and prudentlyfix our criminal justice system. Send them to me to sign.Remember all the road and bridge construction you’ve seen across thestate and the good image it gives Oklahoma when we invest in itsinfrastructure.Remember our desire for safe homes and communities when we makedecisions this session that may or may not affect our prison population,which is at 112 percent capacity.Remember the great policy strides we’ve made to enact the Departmentof Human Services Pinnacle Plan to meet the needs of abused orabandoned children. We now have more safe, loving foster care homes.In fact, Oklahoma has the highest number of gains in foster care homesin the nation!                                                                         9Ronald Reagan once reminded us America is too great for small dreams.Friends, Oklahomans also deserve more than small dreams. They needsolutions to allow their big dreams to come true.Before us is a rare opportunity to bring forth an enduring reality for apromising future. Oklahomans deserve nothing less.Now is the time to summon courage.Now is the time to invest.And now is the time to do the people’s work.Let’s make Oklahoma a special place where we and our children andtheir children choose to live.May God guide you, may God bless you, and may God bless Oklahoma!                                    ###
